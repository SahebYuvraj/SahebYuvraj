# Hi, I’m Yuvraj 👋

I’m a Software Engineering student at the Australian National University (ANU) with a strong interest in systems programming, backend engineering, and applied AI.

I enjoy building things from the ground up — from a POSIX-style shell in Java to computer vision pipelines and full-stack applications. I care about understanding *how* systems work, not just making them work.

### What I’m working on
- Systems and backend projects (Java, Python)
- Networking and low-level tooling
- Applied computer vision and AI projects with the ACT government

### Tools & technologies
- Java, Python, JavaScript/TypeScript
- Linux, Git, networking fundamentals
- AWS
- Backend development and systems programming
- Computer vision & applied AI

### Notable work
- Built a POSIX-style shell in Java (CodeCrafters, global rank #154)
- Drone-based computer vision project for the ACT Government
- Full-stack and mobile applications used by real users
